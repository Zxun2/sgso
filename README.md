## API-Design

The project has adopted the REST architectural style.

<details>
<summary> Read this if you are unclear what exactly is a REST API </summary>

A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.

Source: ![https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api)

</details>

In general, the API is expected to follow the following guidelines:

1. The API should be separated into logical resources.

   - Tours, Reviews, Users etc.

2. Exposed structured, resource-based URLs.

   - {API_URL}/api/v1/users/:id/address/:address

3. Data transfer via HTTP Methods

   - GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE

4. Send data is JSON Format

5. Be stateless
   - All state is handled on the client. This means that each request should contain all the information necessary in order to process a certain request. The API should have to remember previous requests.
   - implemented within application: LoggedIn, Paginate

## Security_Best_Practices

1. Compromised Database

   - Strongly encrypt passwords with salt and hash (bcrypt)
   - Strongly encrypt password reset tokens

2. Brute force Attacks

   - Use bcrypt to make login requests slow
   - Implemented rate limiting

3. Cross-site scripting attacks

   - Store JWT in HTTPOnly cookies
   - Sanitize user input data
   - Set special HTTP headers (helmet package)

4. Denial of Service Attack

   - Implemented rate limiting
   - Limit body payload
   - Avoid evil regular expressions

5. NoSQL Query Injection

   - Use mongoose for MongoDB (because of SchemaTypes)
   - Sanitize user input data

6. OTHER BEST PRACTICES
   - Always use HTTPS
   - Create random password reset tokens with expiry dates
   - Deny access to JWT after password change
   - Don‚Äôt commit sensitive config data to Git
   - Don‚Äôt send error details to clients
   - Prevent parameter pollution causing Uncaught Exception

## Future-Features

1. Currently exploring application integration with Stripe for payment services.
2. Plans to build frontend with HTML and SASS, and convert it into a Pug template.
3. Implement advanced authentication features: confirm user email, keep users logged in with refresh tokens, 2FA etc.

- Security Suggestions:
  - Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (csurf package)
  - Require re-authentication before a high-value action
  - Implement a blacklist of untrusted JWT
  - Confirm user email address after first creating account
  - Keep user logged in with refresh tokens
  - Implement two-factor authentication
  - Implement maximum login attempts

## Slugify

A URL slug is a part that comes at the very end of a URL and is the exact address of a specific page on your website. For example - in <https://slugify.online/campaign-url-builder> URL, "campaign-url-builder" is a slug. Composing a short but descriptive slug for a URL of the web page can positively affect your page's SEO.

[For more information](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan)

## Express-rate-limit

Basic rate-limiting middleware for Express. Use to limit repeated requests to public APIs and/or endpoints such as password reset.

Plays nice with [express-slow-down](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-slow-down).

[For more information](https://github.com/nfriedly/express-rate-limit)

## Helmet

Helmet helps you secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers. _It's not a silver bullet_, but it can help!

[For more information](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet)

## Express-Mongo-Sanitize

[For more information](https://github.com/jsonmaur/xss-clean)

## Path

The `path` module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
[Documentation](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/path.html)

## Cookie-parser

Parse `Cookie` header and populate `req.cookies` with an object keyed by the cookie names. Optionally you may enable signed cookie support by passing a `secret` string, which assigns `req.secret` so it may be used by other middleware.

[For more information](https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-parser)

## Dotenv

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into [`process.env`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html#process_process_env). Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on [The Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/config) methodology.

[For more information](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)

## JsonWebToken

An implementation of [JSON Web Tokens](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519).

This was developed against `draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token-08`. It makes use of [node-jws](https://github.com/brianloveswords/node-jws)

[For more information](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken)

## Util

This implements the Node.js [`util`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v8.x/api/util.html) module for environments that do not have it, like browsers.

[For more information](https://github.com/browserify/node-util)

## Stripe

The Stripe Node library provides convenient access to the Stripe API from applications written in server-side JavaScript.

For collecting customer and payment information in the browser, use [Stripe.js](https://stripe.com/docs/js).

See the [`stripe-node` API docs](https://stripe.com/docs/api?lang=node) for Node.js.

See [video demonstrations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy1nL-pvL2M5xNIuNapwmABwEy2uifAlY) covering how to use the library.

## Multer

Multer is a node.js middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, which is primarily used for uploading files. It is written on top of [busboy](https://github.com/mscdex/busboy) for maximum efficiency.

**NOTE**: Multer will not process any form which is not multipart (`multipart/form-data`).

[For more information](https://github.com/expressjs/multer)

## Sharp

The typical use case for this high speed Node.js module is to convert large images in common formats to smaller, web-friendly JPEG, PNG, WebP and AVIF images of varying dimensions.

Resizing an image is typically 4x-5x faster than using the quickest ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick settings due to its use of [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips).

Colour spaces, embedded ICC profiles and alpha transparency channels are all handled correctly. Lanczos resampling ensures quality is not sacrificed for speed.

As well as image resizing, operations such as rotation, extraction, compositing and gamma correction are available.

Most modern macOS, Windows and Linux systems running Node.js v10+ do not require any additional install or runtime dependencies.

## Axios

Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
