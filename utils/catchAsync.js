// Wrapper Function for all Async
const catchAsync = (fn) => (req, res, next) => {
  fn(req, res, next).catch((err) => next(err));
};

module.exports = catchAsync;

// The async function is being passed as an argument to the catchAsync function.
// The reason for this is to move the error handling outside this async functionto write DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself) code. By doing so, because async functions  always returns a promise (and as we know promises can either be resolved or rejected), then this allows us to pass that functionality to the catchAsync function.

// Given that, had we not wrapped fn inside the anonymous function we returned, then fn would be executed immediately. We don't want that.
// We want express to execute it when a request is made. So by wrapping it inside of the anonymous function, we're not executing it, because it's not a function call.
// Now, because Express is expecting a function as an argument whenever a request is made, Express will only then execute codeblock and therefore execute fn.
// Now, fn as we remember is an async function, so if the promise returned from fn is not resolved, then it's rejected and must be caught, so we'd append the .catch.

// Also, important to rememeber that the Express HTTP methods expects a
// callback function. Which is not possible if you return a IIFE. Hence, the need to return a function.
